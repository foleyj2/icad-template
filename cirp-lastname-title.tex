\section{Main Text}
\label{main}

Here introduce the paper, and put a nomenclature if necessary, in a
box with the same font size as the rest of the paper. The
paragraphs continue from here and are only separated by headings,
subheadings, images and formulae. The section headings are
arranged by numbers, bold and 10 pt. Here follows further
instructions for authors.

\begin{nomenclature}
\begin{deflist}[A]
  \defitem{A}\defterm{radius of} \defitem{B}\defterm{position of}
  \defitem{C}\defterm{further nomenclature continues down the page
    inside the text box\vspace*{-8pt}}
\end{deflist}
\end{nomenclature}
\vspace*{2pt}

\subsection{ Structure}
Files must be in LaTeX format only and should be formatted for direct
printing, using the CRC LaTeX template provided.  Figures and tables
should be embedded and not supplied separately.

Please make sure that you use as much as possible normal fonts in your
documents. Special fonts, such as fonts used in the Far East
(Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.) may cause problems during
processing. To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to
use the `spellchecker' function of TeX~Editor.  Follow this order when
typing manuscripts: Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords,
Main text (including figures and tables), Acknowledgements,
References, Appendix.  Collate acknowledgements in a separate section
at the end of the article and do not include them on the title page,
as a footnote to the title or otherwise.

%%% Needs to be inserted to balance second column
\enlargethispage{-13mm}

Bulleted lists may be included and should look like this:
\begin{itemize}[]
\item First point
\item Second point
\item And so on
\end{itemize}

Ensure that you return to the `Els-body-text' style, the style that
you will mainly be using for large blocks of text, when you have
completed your bulleted list.

Please do not alter the formatting and style layouts which have been
set up in this template document. As indicated in the template, papers
should be prepared in single column format suitable for direct
printing onto paper with trim size 210$\,\times\,$297~mm. Do not
number pages on the front, as page numbers will be added separately
for the preprints and the Proceedings. Leave a line clear between
paragraphs. All the required style templates are provided in the file
``LaTeX Template'' with the appropriate name supplied, e.g. choose
1. Els1st-order-head for your first order heading text,
els-abstract-text for the abstract text etc.

\subsection{ Tables}

All tables should be numbered with Arabic numerals. Every table should
have a caption. Headings should be placed above tables, left
justified. Only horizontal lines should be used within a table, to
distinguish the column headings from the body of the table, and
immediately above and below the table. Tables must be embedded into
the text and not supplied separately. Below is an example which the
authors may find useful.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{An example of a table.}
\begin{tabular*}{\hsize}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lll@{}}
\toprule
An example of a column heading & Column A ({\it{t}}) & Column B ({\it{t}})\\
\colrule
And an entry &   1 &  2\\
And another entry  & 3 &  4\\
And another entry &  5 &  6\\
\botrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}

%\enlargethispage{12pt}

\subsection{ Construction of references}
References must be listed at the end of the paper. Do not begin them
on a new page unless this is absolutely necessary. Authors should
ensure that every reference in the text appears in the list of
references and vice versa. Indicate references by \cite[page 3]{Vander} or
\cite{Strunk,Mettam} in the text.

%% If column needs to be broken in middle of text, add
%% \vadjust{\vfill\pagebreak} --foley
%% Alternatively use the \enlargethispage{-13pt} to shrink

Some examples of how your references should be listed are given at the
end of this template in the `References' section, which will allow you
to assemble your reference list according to the correct format and
font size.

Reference generation by using bibliography style commands for LaTeX
template only.

%The author may use ``model3-num-names.bst'' as per the style required
The author may use ``vancouver.bst'' as per the style required
in document. The sample bib file could be referred.  If the author may
using bibstyle for providing references author must comment the
bibliography section in TeX file, Bibtex will generate the reference
automatically.

If the author may not able to view the references in output same could
be done by copying the bibliography section from ``filename.bbl'' file
and paste in TeX file.



\subsection{Section headings}
Section headings should be left justified, bold, with the first letter
capitalized and numbered consecutively, starting with the
Introduction. Sub-section headings should be in capital and lower-case
italic letters, numbered 1.1, 1.2, etc,~and left justified, with
second~and subsequent lines indented. All headings should have a
minimum of two text lines after them before a page or column break.
Ensure the text area is not blank except for the last page.


\subsection{General guidelines for the preparation of your text}
Avoid hyphenation at the end of a line. Symbols denoting vectors and
matrices should be indicated in bold type. Scalar variable names
should normally be expressed using italics. Weights and measures
should be expressed in SI units. All non-standard abbreviations or
symbols must be defined when first mentioned, or a glossary provided.

\subsection{File naming and delivery}
Please title your files in this order `procedia acronym\_conference
acronym\_authorslastname'. Submit both the source file and the PDF to
the Guest Editor.

Artwork filenames should comply with the syntax ``aabbbbbb.ccc'', where:
\begin{itemize}
\item a = artwork component type
\item b = manuscript reference code
\item c = standard file extension

Component types:
\item gr = figure
\item pl = plate
\item sc = scheme
\item fx = fixed graphic
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Footnotes}
Footnotes should be avoided if possible. Necessary footnotes should be
denoted in the text by consecutive superscript
letters\footnote{Footnote text.}. The footnotes should be typed single
spaced, and in smaller type size (8 pt), at the foot of the page in
which they are mentioned, and separated from the main text by a one
line space extending at the foot of the column. The `Els-footnote'
style is available in the ``TeX Template'' for the text of the
footnote.

Please do not change the margins of the template as this can result in
the footnote falling outside printing range.



\section{Illustrations}
All figures should be numbered with Arabic numerals
(1,2,3,\,$\ldots.$). Every figure should have a caption. All photo-
graphs, schemas, graphs and diagrams are to be referred to as
figures. Line drawings should be good quality scans or true electronic
output. Low-quality scans are not acceptable.  Figures must be
embedded into the text and not supplied separately. In MS word input
the figures must be properly coded. Preferred format of figures are
PNG, JPEG, GIF etc. Lettering and symbols should be clearly defined
either in the caption or in a legend provided as part of the
figure. Figures should be placed at the top or bottom of a page
wherever possible, as close as possible to the first reference to them
in the paper. Please ensure that all the figures are of 300 DPI
resolutions as this will facilitate good output.

The figure number and caption should be typed below the illustration
in 8 pt and left justified [{{\bfseries\itshape Note:}} one-line
captions of length less than column width (or full typesetting width
or oblong) centered]. For more guidelines and information to help you
submit high quality artwork please visit:
http://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions Artwork has no text along
the side of it in the main body of the text. However, if two images
fit next to each other, these may be placed next to each other to save
space. For example, see Fig.~1.

\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace*{10pt}
%\centerline{\includegraphics{fx1}\hspace*{5mm}\includegraphics{fx1}}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=21pc]{gr1}}
\caption{(a) first picture; (b) second picture.}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak

\section{Equations}
Equations and formulae should be typed in Mathtype, and numbered
consecutively with Arabic numerals in parentheses on the right hand
side of the page (if referred to explicitly in the text). They should
also be separated from the surrounding text by one space
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{@{}lcl}
\displaystyle X_r &=& \displaystyle\dot{Q}^{''}_{rad}\left/\left(\dot{Q}^{''}_{rad} + \dot{Q}^{''}_{conv}\right)\right.\\[6pt]
\displaystyle \rho &=& \displaystyle\frac{\vec{E}}{J_c(T={\rm const.})\cdot\left(P\cdot\left(\displaystyle\frac{\vec{E}}{E_c}\right)^m+(1-P)\right)}
\end{array}\vspace*{-12pt}
\end{equation}

All authors are required to complete the Procedia exclusive license
transfer agreement before the article can be published, which they can
do online. This transfer agreement enables Elsevier to protect the
copyrighted material for the authors, but does not relinquish the

\section*{Instructions to Authors for LaTeX template:}

\section{ZIP mode for LaTeX template:}

The zip package is created as per the guide lines present on the URL http://www.elsevier.com/author-schemas/ preparing-crc-journal-articles-with-latex for creating the LaTeX zip file of Procedia LaTeX template.  The zip generally contains the following files:
\begin{Itemize}[]\leftskip-17.7pt\labelsep3.3pt
\item ecrc.sty
\item  elsarticle.cls 
\item elsdoc.pdf
\item .bst file
\item Manuscript templates for use with these bibliographic styles
\item  Generic and journal specific logos, etc.
\end{Itemize}

The LaTeX package is the main LaTeX template. All LaTeX support files are required for LaTeX pdf generation from the LaTeX template package.

{\bf Reference style .bst file used for collaboration support:} In the LaTeX template packages of all Procedia titles a new ``.bst'' file is used which supports collaborations downloaded from the path http://www.elsevier.com/author-schemas/the-elsarticle-latex-document-class
